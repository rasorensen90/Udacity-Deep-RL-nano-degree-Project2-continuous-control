# Report
In this project, the method DDPG is implemented to control 20 robotic arms to follow a sphere.

## DDPG
The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm was introduced in this paper: [Continuous Control With Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf)
The authors present the method as "a model-free, off-policy actor-critic algorithm using deep function approximators that can learn policies in high-dimensional, continuous action spaces".
